## 🚀 Overview

Business Digest is an AI-powered daily briefing engine specifically designed for startup founders who need actionable business intelligence without the research overhead[1]. Our platform delivers curated, real-time insights in under 3 minutes per day, providing founders with a competitive edge in today's fast-paced startup ecosystem[2].

### Why Business Digest?

Modern startup founders face information overload from fragmented sources, making it difficult to identify critical market opportunities and competitive threats[3]. Business Digest solves this by transforming raw data into personalized, actionable insights that align with each founder's specific goals and business stage[4].

## 🧠 The Problem

Startup founders are drowning in information chaos from multiple sources including:

- *Social Media Overload*: Twitter, LinkedIn feeds with mixed signal-to-noise ratios
- *Newsletter Fatigue*: Dozens of industry publications with overlapping content
- *Data Fragmentation*: Crunchbase, job boards, and market research scattered across platforms
- *Time Drain*: Hours spent manually aggregating and analyzing information

This fragmentation leads to three critical issues:

1. *Missed Market Opportunities*: Critical industry shifts go unnoticed
2. *Delayed Competitive Response*: Late reactions to competitor moves
3. *Productivity Loss*: Valuable time wasted on manual research instead of building
